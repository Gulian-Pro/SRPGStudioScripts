Welcome to the RS Mana System, a plugin written by Rogue Claris.

It has been written as an English-community accessible replacement to o-to's MP/SP script. 

This is a "beta" release of the script. I have put together as many featureas as I can, but there is certainly more I can do.

It sets up mana information on all units when installed, but the default move cost is 0 and it tries to auto-grow mana for units.

There are several defaults in place if you don't set up a unit, however none of it is required for regular play.

If a weapon doesn't have an RSMana object in its custom parameters, it won't use mana, simple as that. Same for items.

In order to use the plugin, you must set custom parameters as follows:

-Units & Classes:

{
	RSMana:{
		Cost:5,
		Type:"DRAIN",
		Max:100,
		Cap:300,
		Regen:["PERCENT",20],
		GrowthChance:40,
		Increment:10
	}
}

--Cost: The cost of movement. Set it negative to gain mana on move instead.
--Type: The the way it drains - or "drains" - mana. Set it to DRAIN or DRAINPERCENT.
----If it's DRAINPERCENT, Cost will act as a percent of max mana.
----Can also be ADD or ADDPERCENT. This is another way you can gain mana on move.
--Max: The maximum Mana a unit has. Default is 100.
--Cap: The maximum "Maximum Mana" a unit can ever have. Default is 300.
--Regen: How much mana a unit regains each turn. Default is 20% of max.
----The first is a string, RAW or PERCENT, which determines how the mana is added
----The second is how much mana to add.
----If it's RAW, it adds the mana as a whole number.
----If it's PERCENT, it adds the mana as a percent of max.

-Weapons & Items:

{
	RSMana:{
		Cost:10,
		Gain:10,
		Type:"DRAIN"
	}
}

--Cost: How much it costs to swing this sword or chug this potion.
--Gain: How much you gain by swinging this sword or chugging this potion.
--Type: Can be ADD, ADDPERCENT, DRAIN, or DRAINPERCENT. These should be apparent in effect by now, but...
----ADD increases mana by a raw number of Gain. Incompatible with DRAIN and DRAINPERCENT.
----ADDPERCENT treats Gain as a percent of max mana. Incompatible with DRAIN and DRAINPERCENT.
----DRAIN decreases mana by a raw number of Cost. Incompatible with ADD and ADDPERCENT.
----DRAINPERCENT decreases mana as a percent of max mana. Incompatible with ADD and ADDPERCENT.

-Weapons only:

{
	RSMana:{
		StrikeGain:true,
		StrikeDrain:true,
	}
}

--Can have the same parameters as Items, but additionally can have these two.
--StrikeGain: Can be set as below to regenerate mana based on damage. This will ignore things like Type and Drain.
--StrikeDrain: Can be set the same as below to drain mana from enemies based on damage. This will ignore things like Type and Drain.

-Custom Items:
The same as above, you can set custom Mana-changing items with the custom keyword "RSMana".
Then, set the custom parameters like so:

{
    RSMana:{
        Gain: 20,
        Type: 'ADD'
    }
}

Just like regular items, you can set Gain, Cost, and Type. It just shows custom info about it being a mana-specific item as the item type.

This plugin should be fully compatible with AI. If you notice anything amiss, please contact me.
